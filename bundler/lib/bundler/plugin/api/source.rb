    class API
      # This class provides the base to build source plugins
      # All the method here are require to build a source plugin (except
      # `uri_hash`, `gem_install_dir`; they are helpers).
      #
      # Defaults for methods, where ever possible are provided which is
      # expected to work. But, all source plugins have to override `fetch_gemfiles`
      # and `install`. Defaults are also not provided for `remote!`, `cache!`
      # and `unlock!`.
      #
      # The defaults shall work for most situations but nevertheless they can
      # be (preferably should be) overridden as per the plugins' needs safely
      # (as long as they behave as expected).
      # On overriding `initialize` you should call super first.
      #
      # If required plugin should override `hash`, `==` and `eql?` methods to be
      # able to match objects representing same sources, but may be created in
      # different situation (like form gemfile and lockfile). The default ones
      # checks only for class and uri, but elaborate source plugins may need
      # more comparisons (like, git checking on branch or tag).
